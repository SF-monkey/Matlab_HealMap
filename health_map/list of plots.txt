=================
Plots that require checking rhe red cell/failing devices in health map:

* bar plot, fail counts in Port 1,2,3,4, per build
This tells if different ports perform differently.

* bar plot, total bugs for individual cycle, for all Builds
This tells how extenders perfrom when handling different cycles.

* bar plot, Hosts with most fails per Build
* bar plot, failing DUTs break down by cycles, per Build
* bar plot, monitor with most fails per Build
* bar plot, DUTs with most fails per Build
* bar plot, Ethernet Side Channel fail counts, per build
* bar plot, RS232 fail counts, per build
