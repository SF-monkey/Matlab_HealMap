=================
Plots that require checking the red cell/failing devices in health map:

** bar plot, fail counts in Port 1,2,3,4, per build
This tells if different ports perform differently.

** bar plot, total bug count for individual cycle, for all Builds
This tells how extenders perfrom when handling different cycles.

x* bar plot, Hosts fails count per Build. (Duplicate of Real Bugs by Host per Build)
x* bar plot, failing DUTs break down by cycles, per Build.
(Not enough info from the table, when multiple devices causes multiple fails in a test, lack of info regarding which device is reponseble for which fails.)
** bar plot, monitor with fails count per Build
** bar plot, DUTs with fails count per Build
** bar plot, Ethernet Side Channel fail counts, per build
** bar plot, RS232 fail counts, per build
